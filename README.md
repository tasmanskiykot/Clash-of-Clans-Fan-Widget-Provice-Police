Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

To facilitate our Service;
To provide the Service on our behalf;
To perform Service-related services; or
To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Widget customization function

When creating a widget, the application may ask you for permission to access media files in the mobile storage. This is so that the app can take an image of your desktop and set it as the widget preview background. This will help you fine-tune the widget's background color and transparency. But it is not necessary, you can use the application even without this permission.

Share the link

My app gives you the option to share the app link with your friends and colleagues. When you select the "Share App" option from the menu, you can choose the app through which you want to send this link. Please note that this allows referral information to be shared with other apps, but we do not store any personal data during this process.

Sending a message to the mail

My app also allows you to easily send email messages through your preferred email client. When you select the Send Message option from the menu, you can select an email address and write your message. I guarantee that your data remains confidential and is not used for any purpose other than transmission to your mail client.

App rating

I am always happy to receive feedback from my users! If you like my app and want to support my work, please leave your rating and feedback on the app page in the app store. Your opinion is important to me and will help me improve my app for you and other users.

Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

Children’s Privacy

In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.
